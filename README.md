# Music Mixer
This is the Music Mixer project for our Multimedia Authoring course in Interactive Media Design.

The Music Mixer is a web-based application that allows users to mix audio tracks by dragging and dropping sound elements. The goal is to create an interactive music-mixing experience directly in the browser. The webpage is inspired by a 90s Hip-Hop theme through the audio tracks as well as the page's visual style.
