# Music Mixer
This is our Music Mixer project for our Multimedia Authoring course in Interactive Media Design. Made by Noah Kennedy and Luciano Clementi. 

## About
The Music Mixer is a web-based application that allows users to mix audio tracks by dragging and dropping sound elements. The goal is to create an interactive music-mixing experience directly in the browser. The webpage is inspired by a 90s Hip-Hop theme through the audio tracks as well as the page's visual style.

## Installation 
- Click the green <> Code button
- Click 'Download ZIP'
- Extract files

## Usage 
Use the Music Mixer page to play audio files, mix and match sounds, and create a beat!
